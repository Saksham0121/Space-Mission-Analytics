# 🚀 Space Mission Analysis

An end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project uncovering trends, performance, and insights from global space missions.

---

## 📌 Overview

With the rising interest in space exploration, this project dives deep into a dataset of global space launches to answer key questions:

- 🌍 Who’s leading the space race — countries or private players?
- 🔁 Are reused rockets like those by SpaceX actually reliable?
- 💰 Do higher mission costs lead to more success?
- 📈 How has launch frequency and success evolved over the years?

---

## 🧹 Data & Process

- Cleaned raw space mission data (missing values, formatting, type conversions)
- Conducted EDA using Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- Visualized trends in launch outcomes, cost efficiency, mission types, and more

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🇺🇸 **USA** and 🇷🇺 **Russia** dominate, but private firms like **SpaceX** are rapidly gaining ground  
- 🔁 **Reused rockets** show high success rates — innovation is paying off  
- 💸 **Rocket Lab** offers the lowest cost per successful launch (~$7.5M)  
- 🚀 Launches surged post-2015, driven by commercial advancements  
- 🏛️ Government missions still lead in volume, but **private launches have higher success rates**
